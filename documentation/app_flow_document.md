# Enterprise Platform for Operational Performance (EPOP) App Flow

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
A new user arrives at the EPOP landing page where they are greeted by a brief introduction to the platform and prominent buttons inviting them to sign up or sign in. When the user clicks "Sign Up," they are taken to a form that asks for their name, email address, and a password. After they submit the form, an email verification link is sent. The user clicks that link to confirm their address and is automatically redirected to the sign-in page. Returning users select "Sign In," enter their email and password, and are securely logged in. If a user forgets their password, they click "Forgot Password" on the sign-in page, enter their email address, and receive a reset link. By clicking the link in that email, they land on a page to set a new password and then proceed to sign in normally. Once signed in, they can log out by clicking the user avatar in the header and choosing "Sign Out," which safely ends the session and returns them to the landing page.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
After signing in, the user lands on the main dashboard. On the left side of the screen, a vertical sidebar lists sections for Projects, Messages, Calendar, AI Assistant, and Settings. At the top, a header displays the company logo, the userâ€™s name with an avatar, and a global search field. The center of the page shows high-level widgets including a calendar view of upcoming deadlines, key performance indicators, and a quick overview of recent messages and tasks. From here, the user can click any sidebar item to navigate deeper into that part of the app, use the search field to find conversations or projects, or open the AI Assistant panel by clicking its icon in the header.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
When the user clicks "Messages" in the sidebar, they see a list of conversation threads on the left and the selected conversation on the right. To start a new conversation, they click "New Conversation," enter a title, select participants, and hit "Create." Inside a conversation, the user types into a rich-text composer at the bottom. To attach a file, they click the paperclip icon which requests a presigned upload link from the server, uploads the file directly to MinIO, and then includes the file link alongside the message. Upon hitting "Send," the message is saved in the database, and all participants see it instantly thanks to the live Socket.IO connection. When the user clicks "Projects," they see a list of projects. Choosing one opens its detail page where tasks appear in a Kanban board and a Gantt chart tab. The user can click "Add Task," fill in details like name, assignee, and due date, and save. The page dynamically updates without reloads so the new task appears in the board and on the calendar widget. In the header, clicking the AI Assistant icon slides in a chat panel. The user types a question or prompt into the AI chat input and submits. A streaming response appears below, offering summaries or draft text. They can insert this content into a message or task description with one click. If the user has an ADMIN role, clicking "Admin Panel" in the sidebar opens a new section with user management and system settings pages. From there, the admin can add or remove users, change roles, and adjust global configurations. All navigation between these pages uses client-side routing for a fast, single-page-app feel.

## Settings and Account Management
The user accesses their personal settings by clicking the avatar in the header and selecting "Settings." They arrive at a page with tabs for Profile, Security, Notifications, and Billing. Under Profile, they update their name, email, or avatar, then click "Save Changes" to persist updates. Under Security, they can change their password by providing the current one and choosing a new one. In Notifications, they toggle email or push notifications for mentions, tasks due, or new messages. If the platform offers subscriptions, the Billing tab shows current plan details, payment method, and an option to upgrade or cancel. After making changes in any section, the user clicks "Back to Dashboard" in the sidebar or the home icon in the header to return to the main dashboard.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
If the user enters an incorrect email or password at sign-in, the form displays an inline error message prompting them to try again. If the JWT token expires during a session, the next API call returns a 401 error and the app automatically redirects the user to the sign-in page with a message explaining their session has expired. When uploading a file fails due to network issues, the composer shows a warning and offers a retry button. If a user without ADMIN privileges attempts to access the admin panel, they land on an "Access Denied" page with a link back to the dashboard. For any unknown route, a friendly 404 page appears, guiding the user back to the home page. When the user loses internet connectivity, a banner appears at the top indicating offline mode, and once connectivity returns, the banner disappears and pending operations resume.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
From discovering the platform on the landing page to creating an account and verifying via email, the user moves into a streamlined experience built around a single dashboard interface. They quickly navigate between projects, messages, and the AI Assistant using a left sidebar and header icons. Composing messages and managing files uses real-time updates and direct uploads. Project creation and task tracking flow seamlessly through interactive boards and calendar views. Administrators have an extra path into user and system management pages. Throughout the app, settings and billing are always just a click away, with clear paths back to the dashboard. Error states guide users gently back on track, ensuring the journey from signing up to everyday productivity is smooth and predictable.
